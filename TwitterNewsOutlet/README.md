# CSCD527_Twitter

This project seeks to gather and analyze publicly available twitter data to identify possible major events hopefully before regular media knows anything.

## Project Goals

There are currently three **major** goals for this project.

1. Develop an application that can continuously preprocess twitter stream data and push that data to a data store.
2. Create a schema and query structure to be plugged into PipelineDB. Queries should provide some interesting information about what is being tweeted.
3. Develop an application that can query PipelineDB and visualize the results.
